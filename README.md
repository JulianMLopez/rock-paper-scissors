## Challenges
This project was my first attempt at making a game with a complete UI.
While it was challenging to implement design and UI into my basic code, I feel that the end outcome provided valuable training as shown in my next projects.
In the future, I hope to revist this project and not only clean up my code, but also revamp my UI to make it more engaging.
